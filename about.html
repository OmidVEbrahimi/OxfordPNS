      <p class="p">
        The Oxford Psychological Networks Summer School is a leading, state-of-the-art training programme designed to provide researchers with a rigorous and practical foundation in psychological network analysis, from core principles to advanced modelling techniques.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        This five-day summer school is structured to enable participants to immediately apply network analytic methods to their own research. The programme combines theoretical foundations with hands-on, step-by-step training, equipping attendees with the conceptual understanding, practical skills, and interpretative expertise required to conduct, evaluate, and report high-quality network analytic studies.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        The curriculum provides a comprehensive introduction to the network perspective in psychology, situating it within the broader fields of network science and complex systems research. Participants will be introduced to a wide range of cross-sectional network models, including approaches for systems-based risk factor modelling, comorbidity analysis, group and treatment comparisons, and related applications. The programme further covers an extensive suite of advanced dynamic network models suitable for diverse forms of longitudinal data, including panel data, experience sampling (ESM), intensive time-series and N = 1 designs, as well as large-scale datasets. These methods are presented as tools for modelling psychological dynamics and for understanding mechanisms underlying the maintenance, onset, and emergence of psychological phenomena.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        Throughout the course, participants will receive practical, guided instruction on model estimation, result interpretation, and reporting. The programme addresses methodological considerations across different data types and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, binary, ordinal), and includes a broad range of worked examples demonstrating how network models can be used to address diverse research questions.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        A particular emphasis is placed on enabling researchers to leverage existing and secondary datasets, as well as on guiding participants in the design and collection of new data optimised for network analytic approaches.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        By the end of the summer school, attendees will be fully equipped to implement network analytic methods across the full research pipeline — from data preparation and model estimation to interpretation and publication — thereby maximising the immediate and long-term applicability of these methods in their own research.
